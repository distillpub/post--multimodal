      <i>Gabriel Goh:</i> Research lead. Gabriel Goh first discovered multimodal neurons, sketched out the project direction and paper outline, and did much of the conceptual and engineering work that allowed the team to investigate the models in a scalable way. This included developing tools for understanding how concepts were built up and decomposed (that were applied to emotion neurons), developing zero-shot neuron search (that allowed easy discoverability of neurons), and working with Michael Petrov on porting CLIP to microscope. Subsequently developed faceted feature visualization, and text feature visualization.

      <div style="padding-top: 8px">
      <i>Alec Radford:</i> Developed CLIP. First observed that CLIP was learning to read. Advised Gabriel Goh on project direction on a weekly basis. Upon the discovery that CLIP was using text to classify images, proposed typographical adversarial attacks as a promising research direction.

      <i>Chris Olah:</i> Championed the development of this research direction,  provided research mentorship to all authors throughout, and helped organize research and execution of the final stages of the project before release. Developed diversity feature visualization, which allowed the subsequent development of faceted feature visualizations, which was the engine behind many of the visualizations in the article. Discovered that regional neurons fired for map regions. Wrote section on region neurons, and assisted with the writing style, tone, improving the clarity and tone of writing throughout the article. Also gave numerous helpful suggestions and tips, as well as working with Gabriel Goh to develop the final framing of the article.

      <i>Shan Carter:</i> Worked on initial investigation of CLIP with Gabriel Goh. Did multimodal activation atlases to understand the space of multimodal representations and geometry, and neuron atlases, which potentially helped the arrangement and display of neurons. Provided much useful advice on the visual presentation of ideas, and helped with many aspects of visual design.

      <div style="padding-top: 8px">
      <i>Michael Petrov:</i> Worked on the initial investigation of multimodal neurons by implementing and scaling dataset examples. Discovered, with Gabriel Goh, the original "Spider-Man" multimodal neuron in the dataset examples, and many more multimodal neurons. Assisted a lot in the engineering of Microscope both early on, and at the end, including helping Gabriel Goh with the difficult technical challenges of porting microscope to a different backend.

      <div style="padding-top: 8px">
      <i>Chelsea Voss:</i> Performed investigation of the typographical attacks phenomena, both via linear probes and zero-shot, confirming that the attacks were indeed real and state of the art. Proposed and successfully found "in-the-wild" attacks in the zero-shot classifier. Subsequently wrote the section "typographical attacks". Upon completion of this part of the project, investigated responses of neurons to rendered text on dictionary words. Also assisted with the organization of neurons into neuron cards.

      <div style="padding-top: 8px">
      <i>Nick Cammarata:</i> Proposed and did conditional probability plot for Trump, mental health, and Africa neurons. This included the hand-labelling of more than 400 images and the subsequent discovery that negative activations of neurons were often interpretable. Researched literature on emotions research and wrote the section on Emotion Composition. Helped with web development, and project organization.

      <i>Ludwig Schubert:</i> Helped with general infrastructure.
